## Etch A Sketch Updates

<<<<<<< HEAD
The etch a sketch program now uses the 8x8 LED matrix on I2C and uses two rotary encoders to control movement. use setup.sh to ensure using eQEP on the correct pins. No erase, orange as the indicator of user position. 
Uses p8_33/35 for eQEP1 and p8_41/42 for eQEP2
